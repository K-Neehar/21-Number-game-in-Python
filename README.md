21, Bagram, or Twenty plus one is a classic card game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for centuries.
It is a game of strategy and luck, where players compete to be the first to reach the number 21. 
The game can be played between any number of players, and it is also possible to play against a computer.

In 21, players take turns counting up from 1 to 21, with the player who calls “21” being eliminated. 
It is important for players to pay attention to the numbers called by other players and to choose their numbers wisely. 
For example, when playing against a computer, a player can win by calling a multiple of 4 which will lead to 21 for the computer.

In this game, the player can choose to start first or second, and the list of numbers is shown before the Player takes his turn. 
If consecutive numbers are not given in input, the player is automatically disqualified. 
The player loses if he gets the chance to call 21 and wins otherwise.
21 is an enjoyable and challenging game that can be played with friends, family, and even against a computer. 
With its simple rules, it is a great way to have fun and pass the time.
